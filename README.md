Since we miss Codesmith so much, let's do this Hack Hour style!

Post the algo prompts to the main branch, each algo being its own file.

` git pull origin main ` --> to get new algos

Then, when you are ready to solve the problem, checkout to your own branch and push up on your own branch so we can keep all our solutions separate.

` git checkout YOURLOCALBRANCH `

`  git add . `

`  git commit -m "YOURCOMMENTHERE" `

`  git push origin YOURLOCALBRANCH `
