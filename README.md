**Since we miss Codesmith so much, let's do this Hack Hour style!**

Post the algorithm prompts to the main branch, with each algo being its own file.

` git pull origin main ` --> to get new algos

Then, when you are ready to solve the problem, checkout to your own branch and push up the solution on your own branch so we can keep all our solutions separate.

    git checkout -b YOURBRANCH
    git add .
    git commit -m "YOURCOMMENTHERE"
    git push origin YOURBRANCH
